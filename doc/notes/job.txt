We are looking for a software developer for CryptDB, which is a system
we are building that performs SQL query processing over encrypted data.

CryptDB is a timely project given the wide range of compromises to online
databases that repeatedly occur.  Online applications are vulnerable
to the theft of sensitive information because adversaries can exploit
software bugs to gain access to private data, and because curious or
malicious administrators may capture and leak data.  CryptDB provides
practical and provable confidentiality in the face of these attacks by
fully executing SQL queries over encrypted data, using a collection of
efficient SQL-aware encryption schemes.

We have various pieces of a prototype of CryptDB in place, and are now
looking to develop more of the software with an eye toward releasing it by
the end of the summer, and adding even more features to it post-release.

The desired expertise includes: C++, prior experience in complex software
systems with multiple different components, SQL and relational databases.

The position can be either full-time or part-time, with an ideal time
commitment being through December 2011 or even through May 2012.
The minimum commitment is at least three months.  The position is
available immediately.
