[BackEnd Database Issues]

- If backend MySQL server breaks, i.e., invalid structure tables and invalid state, like: 

 	'[ERROR] Native table 'performance_schema'.'events_waits_summary_by_thread_by_event_name' has the wrong structure'

	Running './mysql_update -u user -ppassword' command fixes structures.
	Executable is found at 'mysql-5.5.14/build/client/mysql_upgrade'
