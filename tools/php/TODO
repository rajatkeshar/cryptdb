-= CryptDB web tool

 Web interface for onion security level adjustments.

TODO:

- Use 'DIRECTIVE <SELECT|UPDATE>' for onion security level adjustments, ex:

To select:
    DIRECTIVE SELECT rating FROM cryptdb_metadata WHERE field = 'x'

To update:
    DIRECTIVE UPDATE cryptdb_metadata SET rating = '<SENSITIVE|PLAIN|BEST_EFFORT>' WHERE field = 'x'

- Make output to be displayed in textarea instead.
- Implement dump results to file.
- Fix proxy connection (currently connecting into backend mysql, see if php has any special statement for proxy connections).
- Do not reload results when clicking submit, keep page static and preserve user's choice selected (sensitive, best effort or unencrypted).
- Use mysqli instead of deprecated mysql API.
- Check integration with cryptdblearn tool (@see tools/learn/cryptdblearn.cc).
- Fix possible session's persistence, login/logoff issues  
- Improve layout.
