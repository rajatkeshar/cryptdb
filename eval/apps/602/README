Some  instructions from Hari:

Basically there's a grades table, a table that catalogs interactions between students and documents, and a key-value table to hold values submitted by the student (keyed by interaction id).
And pset.cgi handles all the on-line pset interactions.
That's different from grades.cgi which is the grades system
