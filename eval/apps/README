This folder contains source code and queries for various applications for our security analysis.

In all apps, we analyze the schema and knowledge of the app to determine sensitive fields.

For each application, we have files:
CRYPTDB_schema -> schema, sensitive fields with onion level, and rationale of why they are sensitive
CRYPTDB_queries -> all query types, or log of queries generated in a long period of time
		PHP-Calendar, 6.02:
		-- we extracted all possible query types from the source code
		-- examined what operations are performed on each field

CRYPTDB_info  -> our procedure for getting the queries in CRYPTDB_queries

We consider that all sensitive fields are encrypted using single principal type encryption, and determine resulting onion level, by analyzing the operations performed on these fields in the queries.
