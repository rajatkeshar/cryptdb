0 Preface
----------

The installation work arounds in this installation guide are based on the input
I have recevied from other users on different systems.  If you encounter
installation issues that are not mentioned here, PLEASE notify (contact info
is in the AUTHORS file).

---------------
1 Requirements
---------------

-PHP 4.1 or higher http://www.php.net/
-MySQL or PostgreSQL (or access to a server running one of these)
-SSH or an FTP program which and utilize the CHMOD command
  For SSH on Windows, try putty at
    http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
  For FTP on Windows, try smartFTP http://www.smartftp.com/
-adodb 4.62 or greater http://adodb.sourceforge.net/

Recommended:
-editor (for editing the configuration files)

---------------
2 Installation
---------------

Instruction for people that are installing on a web host or some computer other than the one that they are working on are indicated with "remote host only"

0) Make sure you have fulfilled all of the requirements listed above
Make sure php, an SQL server, and adodb are installed on your server.
   You can find php at http://php.net/ mysql at http://mysql.com
   postgresql at http://postgresql.org adodb at http://php.weblogs.com/adodb
   You will need php version 4.1 or greater. If you don't have permissions to
   install this globally, you can put it in your php-calendar directory.

1) extract the files from the archive
   (in linux: tar -zxf php-calendar-x.y.tar.gz)

2) (Remote server only) Use FTP to connect the server your webpage is stored on
   and create a new directory where you want to store the calendar (example:
   'calendar' for www.mydomain.com/calendar).  You can call it whatever you
   want.

3) You need to have access to ADOdb from in PHP-Calendar. There are two ways
   to accomplish this.
     a) Add the path to ADOdb to your php include_path in your php.ini
     b) Copy ADOdb into your PHP-Calendar directory (or make a symlink)

4) Open up a browser window and navigate to the file install.php in your
   calendar folder of your webpage (example:
   http://www.mydomain.com/calendar/install.php)

5) Follow the directions given by the installer.

*** freak out if the above did not work ***

More seriously, if this didn't work, see the section below.

3 ERRORS
-----------

this section assumes you are using MySQL, but it may be helpful for everyone.

Message: ERROR  db:1044: Access denied for user: 'MySQLusername@localhost'

Solution: Make sure you have your MySQL username and password correct in the
config.php file.  Contact your host or administrator if you don't know what
they should are.

Message: ERROR  create db:1044: Access denied for user: 'username@localhost'
to database 'databasename': CREATE TABLE phpc_events

Solution: You do not have the abilty to create tables. You need to grant
permission to create tables on the user that you're using for the calendar.

Message: ERROR  Software error  Couldn't select database

Solution: Make sure the name of you MySQL database is correct in the config.php
file.  Contact your host or administrator if you don't know what the database
name is. Make sure the SQL_PREFIX is set to 'phpc_', or whatever the prefix of
your tables is, in the config.php file

4 Translations
---------------

Getting translations working is not automatic yet.

1) You will need to make sure that you have the locale for the desired language
installed. This is very much system dependent. On Debian run
'dpkg-reconfigure locales' as root and select the desired locale.

2) You will need to generate the messages.mo files for each language. In the
LC_MESSAGES directory for each language you will need to run the command
'msgfmt -o messages.mo messages.po'

Good luck!
