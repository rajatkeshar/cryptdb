Q: How do I fit the calendar into the theme of my website?
A: Currently this is an arduous task. You need to edit index.php
   You want to remove the "$html = ..." statement, and the following statement.
   Make it something like:

echo file_get_contents("/your/site/location/header.html"),
	"<body><h1>${config['calendar_title']}</h1>",
// the following should be in, but you can skip the linkbar
	navbar(),
	$output,
	link_bar(),
	"</body></html>";

   I don't make any guarantees on that bit of code, but hopefully it will help
   you get started in the right direction.

Q: How do I allow HTML in the descriptions of events?
A: Read and follow comments in the function parse_desc() in
   includes/calendar.php

Q: How do I get the links for translations to appear?
A: You need to build the .mo files for the languages you want. To do this, go
   into the directory for each language you want (ex. locale/de/LC_MESSAGES)
   and run: msgfmt messages.po
   I have no experience with this in Windows. Read the manual for gettext for
   more information.
