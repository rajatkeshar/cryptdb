PHP-Calendar uses ADOConnection to connect to the DB
To find all SQL executing strings, I used:

grep '$db->[ECSPIOGRA][xaernue][eclPtrp][chepaPoMARC][uecaramnsolE]'

on both levels of the code tree.  This searches for the first five letters of all the possible query methods ADO can have, and returns things that look like '$db->Execute($query)'.  I then looked in the code to find out what the $query was, and transcribed those.
