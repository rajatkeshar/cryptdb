Notes on tput tests:

startphpBB.py is configured for castle, and has cat's home director as EDBDIR
make sure one core on castle is running (or enable threads in phpBB, but that has it's own set of difficulties)

For running through CRYPTDB:

----on castle----
python startphpBB.py

check that L1198 of phpBB3/install/install_install.php is uncommented (this should maybe be added to the schema?)


----on tom----
check the L152 of createstate is pointing to the proxy you just set up

python runtput.py start-uid no-users no-instances no-posts

start-uid should be at 100 (since there are >50 bots that phpBB inserts as part of the its start-up script)

no-posts is the number of posts createstate puts in the forum; I've usually been setting it to 50, but it can be any int
